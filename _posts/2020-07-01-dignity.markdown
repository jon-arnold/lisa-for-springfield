Robertson County is an official "Retire Tennessee" community, and Springfield takes that charge seriously. We must continue to provide a safe, affordable, and enjoyable place for our senior citizens to call home.

* Ensure that seniors have safe access to the services they need, especially during the time of COVID-19 and the high risks that introduces.
* Ensure that seniors have affordable and practical housing options that meet their needs, especially as the housing market continues to change in our community.
