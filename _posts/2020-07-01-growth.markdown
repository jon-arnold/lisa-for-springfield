While Springfield's growth continues to outpace years past, we'd be foolish to forget the history and cultural make-up of our city. We must balance walking confidently into our future with a respect and care for what got us to where we are today.

* While new development blossoms, we need to create and preserve affordable housing to all those who call Springfield home.
* We'll continue to take steps to upgrade our infrastructure in ways that make sense for our community's needs, today and tomorrow â€” without major impact to the tax rate for our citizens.
* Use key infrastructure improvements to improve public health, as well as community prosperity.
* Our city acts as a historical waypoint for residents and tourists alike. We must do our best to preserve historical architecture and elements to preserve the character and history of Springfield.
