As the world continues to change in both working life and the skills needed to do today's jobs, Springfield should foster a strong and agile workforce who can meet those needs. We will push for equality and equity in our education programs, so that everyone has a great opportunity for a career in and around our city.

* Support hands-on training programs for our current workforce to help close the skills gap.
* Support a strong K-12 educational foundation for our city's future leaders.
* Support and promote youth education programs to augment K-12 and college education, with a focus on closing the educational achievement gap often seen across gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic statuses.
