As we continue to adapt to the ever-changing face of this global crisis, Springfield must continue to stay focused on the needs of our hard-working families and those at greater risk to the virus. We will:

* Continue to support best practices and actions recommended by global and US health experts to prevent the spread of the disease.
* Support emergency assistance for those in devastating situations (homelessness, debt, foreclosure, etc).
* Ensure public testing and healthcare programs are strong, fast, and available for all who need them.
