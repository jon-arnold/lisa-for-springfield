Springfield is growing and we have more reason than ever to be proud of our city. We should tend to the growth of our city to ensure we reap all the benefits of the hard work we've all put in.

* Give a leg up to any new small businesses in Springfield by keeping development competitive and ensuring small businesses are aware of and have access to the tools and programs they need to succeed.
* Continue to attract businesses that our community needs and wants, while maintaining an inclusive and diverse business culture in Springfield â€” serving all spectrums of business and walks of life.
* Support our businesses as they adapt to the "new normal" of serving customers in a pandemic environment.
