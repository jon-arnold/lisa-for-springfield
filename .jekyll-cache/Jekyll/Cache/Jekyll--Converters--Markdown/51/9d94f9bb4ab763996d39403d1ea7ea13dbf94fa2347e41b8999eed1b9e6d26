I"—<p>While Springfieldâ€™s growth continues to outpace years past, weâ€™d be foolish to forget the history and cultural make-up of our city. We must balance walking confidently into our future with a respect and care for what got us to where we are today.</p>

<ul>
  <li>While new development blossoms, we need to create and preserve affordable housing to all those who call Springfield home.</li>
  <li>Weâ€™ll continue to take steps to upgrade our infrastructure in ways that make sense for our communityâ€™s needs, today and tomorrow â€” without major impact to the tax rate for our citizens.</li>
  <li>Use key infrastructure improvements to improve public health, as well as community prosperity.</li>
  <li>Our city acts as a historical waypoint for residents and tourists alike. We must do our best to preserve historical architecture and elements to preserve the character and history of Springfield.</li>
</ul>
